# Pimoroni Plasma Stick orange flickering effect

## About

This code creates an orange flickering effect on a LED strip
connected to a Pimoroni Plasma Stick microcontroller.

It first performs a fade-in animation where all LEDs gradually
increase in brightness, then enters an infinite loop where it
randomly selects LEDs and slightly varies their hue to create a
flame-like flickering effect.

The colours are kept within an orange spectrum using HSV colour values.
